# React App with Icon Enhancements

This project is a simple yet visually appealing React application built using **Reactstrap** and **React Icons**. It demonstrates how to create an interactive and responsive user interface that features:

- A **hero section** with a welcome message and icons.
- **Interactive icons** that respond to user interactions with smooth hover effects.
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

## Features

### 🌟 Hero Section
The application features a hero section with a clear and welcoming heading, description, and interactive icons (`FaCalendarAlt` and `FaInfoCircle`). The icons are designed to enhance the user experience and engage users with hover effects.

### 🚀 Interactive Icons
The icons in the hero section have hover effects that increase their size and change their color, providing a more dynamic and engaging interface.

### 📱 Responsive Layout
Built with the **Reactstrap grid system**, the layout automatically adjusts to the screen size, ensuring that the content is displayed in an optimized format across all devices.

### 🎨 Custom Styling
The project includes custom CSS for the hover effects on icons, making them grow slightly and change color when hovered over, offering a visually interactive feel.
